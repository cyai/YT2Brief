# YT2Brief 📺📝

Hey there, welcome to YT2Brief – where I make watching YouTube videos a breeze! This is just a fun little project I put together to help you turn those lengthy videos into quick, easy-to-digest summaries.

**What's the deal?**

You know those times when you want to catch up on some YouTube content, but you don't have hours to spare? That's where YT2Brief comes in. I use some fancy tech like Langchain and our private LLMs, along with OpenAI's LLMs, to transcribe and summarize videos for you.

**How it works:**

1. 🎬 Drop a YouTube link.
2. ⚙️ Let our tech do its thing.
3. 📜 Get a snappy summary!

**Why YT2Brief?**

-   No more long videos hogging your time.
-   Cool tech like Langchain in action.
-   Your data is safe with us (thanks to private LLMs).
-   OpenAI's LLMs add extra magic.

So, why not give it a shot? Watch more, in less time. 😎

Just a heads up, this is a pet project, so don't expect perfection. But I promise it's a neat little tool to have fun with.
